\chapter{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

Describe all details of the experiments in a way that the reader is able to reproduce your experiments.
Provide an overview table (or multiple tables) with all experiments, data sets and all parameters used.
Give the different experiment runs a unique name and refer to this name in the results section.

Keep interim data from your experiments (e.g. predicted labels per instance, confusion matrices, etc.) in case you need to come back to the data to calculate further metrics.
