\chapter{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}


Discuss any open issues and give a critical reflection of your work. E.g., what could be problems to deploy your method or do you have an idea how your findings could be generalized or what could be a hindrance for generalization?

Also discuss strange things you observed or results you could not completely explain.
