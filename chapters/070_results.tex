\chapter{Results} \label{sec:results}

\begin{itemize}
	\item maximum accuracy with 0-90-10 pre-sup-val training
	\item comparison between pretraining accuracy with different proxy tasks for 10-80-10 pre-sup-val training
	\item comparison between pretraining accuracy with different proxy tasks for 1-89-10 pre-sup-val training
	\item comparison between pretraining accuracy with different proxy tasks for subset 10\_flows subset pre-sup-val training
	\item comparison of performance improvements for different amounts of supervised training
	\item comparison of performance improvements for different compositions of pretraining data
	\item comparison between multiple datasets
	\item comparison to orthogonal initialization
\end{itemize}

\section{Long Short-Term Memory Network}

\begin{itemize}
	\item provide data for maximum results including class stats for both datasets to establish a feel for the maximally possible accuracy with supervised training and 90\% of data
	\item show results for different amounts of supervised data and discuss results between different proxy tasks by showing loss progression and validation accuracy over training time and comparing class stats
	\item highlight the improvement in accuracy when comparing to supervised training only
	\item look closely at differences in loss progression and validation accuracy over time between different proxy tasks
\end{itemize}

\section{Transformer Network}

\section{Explainability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item close look at differences in performance for different attack classes
	\item partial dependency plots
	\item neuron activation
\end{itemize}
