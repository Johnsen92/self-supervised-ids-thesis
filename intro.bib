However, RNNs consisting of sigma cells or tanh cells are unable to learn the relevant information of input data when the input gap is large. By introducing gate functions into the cell structure, the long short-term memory (LSTM) could handle the problem of long-term dependencies well. Since its introduction, almost all the exciting results based on RNNs have been achieved by the LSTM. The LSTM has become the focus of deep learning. We review the LSTM cell and its variants to explore the learning capacity of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, the LSTM networks are divided into two broad categories: LSTM-dominated networks and integrated LSTM networks. In addition, their various applications are discussed. Finally, future research directions are presented for LSTM networks.}",

	abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves: the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands: indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

	abstract = {Time series forecasting (TSF) is the task of predicting future values of a given sequence using historical data. Recently, this task has attracted the attention of researchers in the area of machine learning to address the limitations of traditional forecasting methods, which are time-consuming and full of complexity. With the increasing availability of extensive amounts of historical data along with the need of performing accurate production forecasting, particularly a powerful forecasting technique infers the stochastic dependency between past and future values is highly needed. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach capable to address the limitations of traditional forecasting approaches and show accurate predictions. The proposed approach is a deep long-short term memory (DLSTM) architecture, as an extension of the traditional recurrent neural network. Genetic algorithm is applied in order to optimally configure DLSTMâs optimum architecture. For evaluation purpose, two case studies from the petroleum industry domain are carried out using the production data of two actual oilfields. Toward a fair evaluation, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with several standard methods, either statistical or soft computing. Using different measurement criteria, the empirical results show that the proposed DLSTM model outperforms other standard approaches.}
